# DevWeb 3 - Repo

![Code and coffee, there's no such a thing](./codemedium.jpg)
This repo is a continuation of 'PHP7'. So we have first 'DevWeb', second 'PHP7' and finally this one. Splitting was due to organization concerns.
This repo constains or will contain tests using PHP(PDO), MySQL, Ajax, jQuery, MVC architecture, Slim Framework, SASS and other useful technologies.
